      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I’m Keri West, a solutions-driven web developer and manager who’s
        highly collaborative and thrives in a communal and progressive
        atmosphere. I have proven experience in consumer-focused website
        building, development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO best practices, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m the Web Manager for Humble & Fume Inc., where I work
        cross functionally to maintain the company’s multiple B2B sites. During
        my time here, I’ve boosted our SEO position on Google search, have
        maintained and uploaded thousands of products (which includes image
        editing, descriptions, option sets, etc), written the Standard Operating
        Procedure for maintaining brand standards across web, and have managed
        hundreds of successful sales.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <h4>Web Manager | humble + fume</h4>
      <p>
        I'm an experienced web product & content manager with a demonstrated
        history of working in B2B and B2C marketplaces. I have an extensive
        background in eCommerce product management—product descriptions,
        metadata, SEO, lifecycle management, implementing sales/promotions on
        websites, boosting in-store search, curating categories as well as
        photoshop photo editing skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year I have moved more into learning and exploring the
        coding side of eCommerce websites, and am very interested in learning
        more about front end web and back end web development.
      </p>
