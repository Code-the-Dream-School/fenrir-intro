    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Mariya, I am from Minsk (Belarus). 
        In the fall of 2021, my family immigrated to the USA as green card lottery winners. <br>
        I have a master's degree in musical art. <br>
        I've always been interested in development as well and now I can finally realize my dream.
        </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        Throughout my life I have always worked in the field of music education.<br>
        From 2013 to 2019, I worked as a Music Theory Teacher at the Children's music school No. 20 of the city of Minsk.<br>
        From 2019 to autumn 2021, I worked at the Belarusian State Academy of Music as a Junior Researcher in the Research department.<br>
        Now I work as an educator and music teacher in the education center Sport+Academy.<br>
        In early 2021, before the immigration, I independently studied the basics of SQL and HTML on the site sololearn.com.<br>
        In February 2023, I began to study the basics of JavaScript in the Russian language.<br>
        Since March 2023 I have been studying in the Intro to Programming class organized by codethedream.org.<br>
