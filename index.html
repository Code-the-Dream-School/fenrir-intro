"About"
Hi, my name is Mila Kovach. I am a student at Coding Dream, and  currently learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, but I would like to learn more languages in the future.
I am excited to start my career in web development. I want to create websites and applications that foster inspiration in others, and to use my skills in math and problem solving to achieve that.
