Leonardo Reyes

About
Hi, my name is Leonardo. I am a curious person by nature. I like knowing how things work and enjoy learning. My family and I moved to the U.S. when I was 10 years old. I am what most people have come to know as a Dreamer and DACA Recepient. I am grateful for the challenges and barriers that I have experienced in my life because they ground me to the shared struggle of those around me. The struggle to overcome adversity in itself can provide an opportunity to think critically about widely accepted norms and standards. 

Technology increasingly plays a larger role of how our social systems are implement and maitained. It is therefore of outmost important that, as these systems are created, we are able to think critically of the unintended impact these systems may have on communities whose lived experienced is often more complex than the systems we build. 

I have worked in social services for the past decade. I now look forward to making a transition into Technology where my hope is to contribute towards the innotivate technologies that are inclusive of the diverse tapestry of our communities.
