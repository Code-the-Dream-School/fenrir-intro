          Hello, I’m Keri West, a solutions-driven web developer and manager
          who’s highly collaborative and thrives in a communal and progressive
          atmosphere. I have proven experience in consumer-focused website
          building, development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO best practices, and
          more.
          <br />
          Currently, I’m the Web Manager for Humble & Fume Inc., where I work
          cross functionally to maintain the company’s multiple B2B sites.
          During my time here, I’ve boosted our SEO position on Google search,
          have maintained and uploaded thousands of products (which includes
          image editing, descriptions, option sets, etc), written the Standard
          Operating Procedure for maintaining brand standards across web, and
          have managed hundreds of successful sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm an experienced web product & content manager with a demonstrated
          history of working in B2B and B2C marketplaces. I have an extensive
          background in eCommerce product management—product descriptions,
          metadata, SEO, lifecycle management, implementing sales/promotions on
          websites, boosting in-store search, curating categories as well as
          photoshop photo editing skills.
          <br />
          Over the past year I have moved more into learning and exploring the
          coding side of eCommerce websites, and am very interested in learning
          more about front end web and back end web development.
